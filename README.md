## About Us:
This is the homepage of DSE Education led by [Dr. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/) from Michigan State University (MSU). We are working on **AI for Education (AI4EDU)** via AI technologies (like LLM, AI Agent, GenAI, Transformer, SSL, GNN, XAI, etc.).

## Our Papers on AI for Education:

- Knowledge Tagging with Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System, AAAI 2025, (**AAAI/IAAI 2025 Deployed Application Award**). [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08406)
- ErrorRadar: Benchmarking Complex Mathematical Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models Via Error Detection, arXiv 2024. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04509)
- Knowledge Tagging System on Math Questions via LLMs with Flexible Demonstration Retriever, arXiv 2024. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13885)

## Our Survey/Position on AI for Education:
- Large Language Models for Education: A Survey and Outlook, 2024. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18105)
- Bringing Generative AI to Adaptive Learning in Education, 2024. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14601)
